# 🚀 SwiftCityTycoon - SSC 2026 Submission

## 🌃 Code is Currency, Code is Security.

**SwiftCityTycoon** is a highly polished, **Cyberpunk-themed** Edutainment Prototype submitted for the Swift Student Challenge 2026. This project successfully merges a futuristic life simulator with interactive Swift debugging challenges.

The core goal is to engage students by making learning immediately rewarding:
* **Progress is Gated by Code:** The player unlocks access to high-value assets (flying cars, security systems) only by fixing critical code malfunctions.
* **Technical Focus:** Demonstrates mastery over core Swift syntax, including **Functions**, **Arrays**, and **For Loops**, within a custom-designed SwiftUI interface.

Swift City Tycoon is an **Edutainment Prototype** designed to gamify the process of learning Swift programming fundamentals within an immersive, high-stakes **Cyberpunk** world. The core concept is simple: **Code is Currency, and Code is Security.** Players earn in-game wealth (SwiftCoins) and unlock progress by successfully solving real-world code debugging scenarios presented as "system malfunctions" in the futuristic city.

## 🎯 Educational Goals

This prototype focuses on making foundational Swift concepts challenging and immediately rewarding by forcing the user to **analytically fill the blank** in live code snippets. The three core concepts demonstrated are:
1.  **Functions:** Understanding return types (using the `Bool` return type).
2.  **Arrays:** Safely accessing data using index numbers.
3.  **For Loops:** Controlling iteration range for automated systems.

## 🎮 The 3-Minute Experience (Prototype Walkthrough)

The demo guides the user through a quick narrative arc, showcasing the core loop: **Challenge → Debug → Reward**.

1.  **Scene 1: Launch Authentication:** The player must fix the `authenticatePilot` **Function** by providing the correct Boolean return value to unlock their high-tech **Drone-Taxi**.
2.  **Scene 2: Inventory Acquisition:** The player must debug the inventory system's **Array** access to purchase a critical hacking tool (Code Injector V4).
3.  **Scene 3: The Final Heist:** The player must adjust a **For Loop** to breach a high-security vault by sending the required number of decryption packets.

## ⚙️ Technical Highlights (Built with SwiftUI)

* **Custom Code Input View:** Implemented a unique, visually integrated input system within the SwiftUI view, moving beyond standard Playgrounds console interaction.
* **Aesthetic:** Dark, neon-heavy Cyberpunk theme (Purple/Black Palette) to enhance immersion.
* **Animations:** Smooth, rewarding animations (sliding door, coin flow, neon flashes) to provide immediate feedback for successful coding.
